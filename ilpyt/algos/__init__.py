"""
Algorithms are the main entrypoint for the ilpyt library. An algorithm's role 
during learning is to perform the high-level coordinatination between agent and 
environment during train and test time. An algorithm's key functions include a 
`train` and `test` function. 

To create a custom algorithm, see `BaseAlgorithm` for more details.
