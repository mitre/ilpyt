"""
An agent's role during learning is to coordinate the policy learning and 
execution. Here, the policy refers to a function (in this case, a deep neural 
network), which maps states to actions. An agent's key functions include a 
`step` and `update` function. 

To create a custom agent, see `BaseAgent` for more details.
